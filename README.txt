Flawed Engine
	
	This is going to be a small hobby engine that I will be writing.
This engine will not be a feature-ful engine, since I am still a student
and I don't have the neither the time nor the enough knowledge to build
a "good" engine.

PS: Engine's name might change.

Main features:
	- Loading of 3D models.
	- Serialization of scenes.
	- Simple Lighting/Shadows (nothing fancy)
	- Basic UI
		- Editing models' pos/rot/scale and texture/materials.
		- Ability to add pre-made objects (Cubes/Sphere/etc) 
		- World Editor (like in UE4 to show all entities)

Purpose: 
	- Mainly practice
	- Learning OpenGL deeper
	- Getting more projects under my name

About me:
	I am a student in Sweden, very intersted in computer graphics
and programming in genral. Got into C++ and eventually OpenGL. I can OK
C++, not the best but I have most of the intermediat-advanced C++ knowledge.
OpenGL on the other hand I'm not so good with, (game engine might be a bad choice
of project), but I have read most of the LearnOpenGL.com and I have some books
about game engines in general.

DISCLAIMER:
////I am not the best with github and git in general that's why my project files
////looks so terrible.
